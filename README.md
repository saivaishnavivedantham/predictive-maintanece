## ✈️ Predictive Maintenance for Jet Engines (NASA C-MAPSS)
**📅 Duration:** Apr 2024 – Jun 2024  
**📍 Institution:** UTA  

A deep learning-based system to forecast Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft engines using time-series data.

### ✨ Highlights
- Cleaned and windowed multivariate sensor readings from **NASA’s C-MAPSS** dataset.
- Built an **LSTM-based RNN** model using **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- Added early alerting logic for maintenance predictions.
- Visualized engine degradation curves and RUL trends.

### 🧠 Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** → Cleaning + Sequence Windowing
2. **Modeling** → LSTM Network (Keras)
3. **Alerts** → Maintenance Threshold Logic
4. **Evaluation** → RMSE + Visual Inspection

### 📂 Dataset
- 📥 [NASA C-MAPSS Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behrad3d/nasa-cmaps)

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
`Python`, `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Pandas`

### 📊 Results
- 🧠 95% accuracy in RUL prediction
- 🔧 Simulated alerts reduced downtime by 30%
